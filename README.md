# High-School-Periodic-Table
The 2019-2020 Oklahoma Technology Student Association State Software Development competition first place winning project. The authors include Zakarea Yoosuf (me), Tekena Harcourt, Nicholas Phillips, and Sean (sorry bro I forgot your last name). 

The PeriodTable.java file is what I wrote, but the project can be run after extracting the zip file.

The purpose of this project was the create a concise and informational guide for students taking PreAP Chemistry as was offered at our school. When working on homework, I prefer to eliminate distractions by disabling the WiFi on my laptop whenever I am doing work when possible; however, there was a lot of information that not only I, but many students found necessary to refer to while doing our homework that would not be available without accessing the internet. Sure, students could keep offline screenshots, but every time a new piece of information needed to be aggregated, a new screenshot would have to be taken. Hence, development for this project began.
